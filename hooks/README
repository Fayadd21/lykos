You can place custom (non-gamemode, non-role) code into this directory and it will be automatically imported.
Files beginning with an underscore (e.g. _foo.py) will not be imported and files in nested directories will not be
imported either. You can use either of these strategies to "disable" code temporarily or have supporting libraries.
